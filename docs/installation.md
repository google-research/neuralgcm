# Installation

For best performance, we recommend running NeuralGCM models on a computer with
an attached GPU or TPU. Otherwise, performance will be very slow.

You can install NeuralGCM from source using pip, which should automatically
install its dependencies, including [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and
[Dinosaur](https://github.com/neuralgcm/dinosaur):
```
pip install neuralgcm
```
